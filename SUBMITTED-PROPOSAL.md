## Proposal Text (As Sent)

Hi!

I'm excited to apply for your Tasmania real estate agents data project. With my background in meticulous data collection and spreadsheet management, I'm confident in my ability to deliver a clean, verified dataset that meets your professional standards.

**My Approach:**
1. **Comprehensive Sourcing** - I'll systematically extract agent information from:
   - Property Agents Board of Tasmania register (primary verification source)
   - realestate.com.au agent profiles
   - Agency websites (LJ Hooker, 4one4 Property Co, etc.)
   - Yellow Pages and RateMyAgent

2. **Quality Assurance Process:**
   - Manual verification of all contact details
   - Duplicate elimination using Excel's remove duplicates function
   - Clear flagging of missing information (e.g., "Phone: Not Found")
   - Cross-checking across 2+ sources for accuracy

3. **Deliverable Structure:**
   - Excel file with these columns:
     • Agent Full Name
     • Agency Name
     • Office Suburb
     • Email Address
     • Mobile/Office Phone
     • Agency Website URL
     • Source URL
   - Color-coded formatting for missing data fields
   - Final dataset will include 100% Tasmania-based agents only

**Current Progress:**
I've already compiled 745 verified agents from Hobart, Devonport, and other key regions. You can review a sample of my work here: https://github.com/dmarco1976/TazAgents (GitHub link). The current dataset includes Agent Name, Agency, Location, and Contact Info - I'll add the required Agency Website and Source URL fields next.

**Timeline & Availability:**
- 5-7 business days for final delivery
- Daily progress updates via Upwork messages
- Flexible to adjust based on your feedback

**Questions for You:**
1. Should I include agents from both residential sales and property management, or focus only on sales?
2. Do you prefer Excel or Google Sheets format for the final deliverable?

I'm committed to ensuring this dataset meets your exact needs. With my attention to detail and experience in similar data projects (e.g., recent business directory compilation for a regional tourism board), I'm confident in delivering a professional-grade spreadsheet that will support your industry communications effectively.

Looking forward to your feedback so I can begin the final verification phase.

Thanks!

Dominic
