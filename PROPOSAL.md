# Upwork Proposal: Tasmania Real Estate Agents Data Collection

## Cover Letter

```
Hi there,

I've already started on this. I have 444 Tasmania real estate agents collected
from LJ Hooker, 4one4 Property Co, and other agencies across Hobart, Devonport,
St Helens, and Wynyard.

You can preview my work here: [GitHub repo link]

Current columns: Agent Name, Agency, Role, Phone, Email, Location. I'll add
Agency Website URL and Source URL as you specified, plus verify all entries
for duplicates and missing data.

I'm building my Upwork portfolio, so I'm prioritizing accuracy over speed—your
review matters more than this invoice.

Timeline: I can deliver the complete, verified spreadsheet within 5-7 days.

Questions before I continue:
- Do you need agents from property management, or sales only?
- Preferred format: Excel or Google Sheets?

Dominic
